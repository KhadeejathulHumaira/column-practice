## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned about flex-box and its uses.


```html
<div class="container">
  <p class="item">Hello </p>
  <h1  class="item">Flex</h1>
</div>
```
```css
.container {
  display:flex;
  flex-direction:row;
  justify-content:center;
  align-items:center;
}
.item{
  flex-grow:1;
}
```

display:flex-
    This will help the items inside the container to change according to its parent.
flex-direction:row-
    This is by default will be in row ,If needed we can also use column ,reverse-row,column-reverse.
flex-grow:1-
    This will allow the items inside the container to take up the left out spaces equally.
justify-content:center-
    This will help to align the items horizontally in the center, We also have some other options like flex-start ,flex-end ,I will link the website below for reference .
align-items:center-
    This will align the items vertically in the center.
### Continued development
Though my website is responsive ,I need to concentrate much in the 'rem' part so that my website will be responsive .

### Useful resources
